<!-- Required. The launcher (deploy/claude-headless.sh → framework/cli/build-origin.mjs capture) records this block on
     the build as origin.said (build-origin@1), and every view of the build shows it first as "What Brett said".
     The meta line is optional: Source = voice | chat | console | code. Your own reading of what he wants goes in
     the sections below, never in this block. -->

## What to build
Your paraphrase, the plan, the steps (s1 …), checks.

## Docs (every build)
Ship a basic Markdown readme in the same PR: `docs/README.md` inside the plugin / app / module folder this build adds
or changes (or a section added to an existing one): what it does, how to use it (screens, settings, right-click
actions, voice commands), commands (API / MCP / CLI) and troubleshooting. Plain Markdown, no docs engine.
`node framework/cli/check-docs-readme.mjs` fails CI on a new folder without one.

## Addendum 1 (Brett, Nov 4 2026 (voice))
