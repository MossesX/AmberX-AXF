/**
 * build-pipeline@1 — the pipeline record on a builds@1 build and the three table states (pure, IO-free).
 *
 * Brett, Nov 8 2026 ("You need to start the pipeline over from scratch"): everything he asks for becomes a build in the
 * orchestrator, which assigns the id, splits it into steps (≤ 10 min, checkpoints inside one session; Fable only where needed) and puts it in
 * **Pending**. He moves builds from Pending to the **Queue**. A dispatcher on the VPS watches the connected Claude
 * accounts (which have Fable, how many may run in parallel) and the agent slots; when a slot is free it takes the next
 * Queue build and starts a headless session on an account that can run the next phase's model (**Building**).
 *
 *   status flow:  pending → queued → running (Building) → built → complete
 *                 a session that ends with steps left goes back to queued (crash / limit, up to maxRuns) or to pending
 *                 (stopped on purpose: UI Review wait, a question); failed after maxRuns.
 *
 * `pipeline` on a build (kept across orchestrator, Pending and queue writes; only the dispatcher and the queue
 * actions change it):
 *   queuedAt   ISO: when it entered the Queue ('' in Pending)        queuedBy  who queued it (brett | auto | console | …)
 *   account    the Claude account the current / last run is on       session   its tmux session (axf-<id>--<agent>)
 *   slot       the agent-slots entry id of the current run           model     the model that run started on
 *   launchedAt ISO of the current / last launch                      runs      how many sessions have run it
 *   lastRun    { at, exit, outcome, stepsLeft, account, session }    outcome = finished | requeued | returned | failed
 *   split      { at, by, provider, steps, note }                     how its steps were made (claude | rules | hand)
 *   splitRequested  ISO: the console asked for a (re)split; the next tick does it
 *   note       one plain line the Pipeline view shows (why it waits, what happened last)
 *   route      '' (auto: subscriptions, then API only when the overflow rule is on) | 'api' (run on an API-key account,
 *              billed per token, under its caps) | 'subscription' (never an API account). Brett's per-build override.
 *   dispatchedAt  ISO of the orchestrator dispatch that started the current run (its token is in the dispatcher's files)
 *   planned    { model, account, kind, at, why }  the orchestrator's plan, made as soon as the build is split (Brett,
 *              Nov 10 2026: "He'll plan what model, what account"); refreshed while it waits
 *   tried      accounts the final pick tried and that refused this run (launch failed), in order; '' list on a clean pick
 *   pickedAt   ISO of the final account decision (the moment the build's turn came in the Queue)
 *   heldAt, heldBy, heldWhy  On hold (Brett, Nov 10 2026: "Make a hold status … leave in queue on hold"): the build stays
 *              in the Queue, keeps its place, and the dispatcher skips it until it is released. '' = not held.
 *
 * The orchestrator's tabs (Brett, Nov 10 2026: "Tabs: pending, active, incomplete, complete, errors, queue"): tabOf().
 *
 * Step dependencies and claims (Nov 13 2026, build always-fill-every-slot: "when slots are free, run independent steps
 * of running builds in parallel across them"). Two optional fields on a builds@1 step (spec/BUILD-PARALLEL.md):
 *   after   [stepId]  the steps of the same build that must be done (or skipped) before this one may start.
 *                     NO `after` field = implicitly sequential: the step waits for the step before it in the list, so
 *                     every build from before this contract runs exactly as it did. `after: []` = independent: it may
 *                     start as soon as the build runs. Ids name steps of the same build; a step never names itself;
 *                     cycles and unknown ids are refused by the store check (builds-store.mjs).
 *   claim   { runId, slot, account, branch, at, model, expiresAt } | null  the session working the step right now.
 *                     Model-aware: `model` is the step's pinned model the session was launched on (never higher).
 *                     A claim lives CLAIM_TTL_MS from `at` (expiresAt); past it the step is ready again (a session that
 *                     died without releasing). Ticking a step done releases its claim. `branch` is the parallel step's
 *                     worktree branch (<build-branch>--s<n>) or the build branch for a sequential step.
 * Helpers: normAfter / normClaim (shape), dependsOn(build, step) (the resolved list, implicit sequential included),
 * claimLive(claim, now), stepBranch(build, step).
